# ðŸ“¸ Stills-2-Video
*A Simple Client-Side Image Sequence to Video Converter*

![stills2video app screenshot showing image drag and drop functionality](assets/logo.png)

Stills-2-Video is a simple, client-side web application for turning your still images into a video, right in your browser! No uploads to a server, no external services.

I built this because i was getting sick of messing around with ffmpeg or fire up something heavy like Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro everytime I needed to create a video from a sequence of images.

**Disclaimer:** This project is very much a **work-in-progress** and was built with a fair bit of **vibe coding** and experimental exploration. Functionality is pretty limited, but the core idea is there! 

## âœ¨ Features (Current & Planned)

### Current Capabilities:

*   **Drag & Drop Image Import:** Easily bring your images into the app.
*   **WebM Video Export:** Generate videos in the WebM format directly in your browser.
*   **Client-Side Processing:** All the heavy lifting (image ordering, video encoding) happens locally on your machine.
*   **Simple Image Ordering:** Sorting by filename, date modified, file size, or manual drag-and-drop reordering.

### Planned / Future Ideas:

*   **More Export Options:** Control over frame rate, resolution, and perhaps even alternative video formats (if browser support allows or with a heavy-duty WASM solution).
*   **User Interface Refinements:** Making the experience a little less bad.

## ðŸš€ Get Started (For Developers)

This project is built with TypeScript, React, Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/robrab2000/stills2video.git
    cd stills2video
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite chooses).
